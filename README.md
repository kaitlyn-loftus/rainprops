# RAIN PROPS
(**Prop**ertie**s** of **rain**drops.)

Code for "The Physics of Falling Raindrops in Diverse Planetary Atmospheres" by Loftus & Wordsworth. (Henceforth LoWo21.)

Core model is within the src/ directory.
Main article figures and tables labelled by number.
Supplemental material figures and table labelled by content.

Run ``LoWo21.sh`` to reproduce all results, figures, and tables from LoWo21. (This script just systematically runs the assorted python files.) Adjust ``IS_CALCULATE`` depending on whether you'd like to re-run all calculations. If yes, be forewarned the code will take a few hours to run everything as it is not overly optimized for speed. If no, do not modify internal file structure.
